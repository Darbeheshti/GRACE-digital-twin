# GRACE satellites accelerometer time series analysis

# Problem defenition
This is a quick 5-week project that began on May 22, 2023. The main goal is to use machine learning techniques to rebuild the accelerometer data (ACC) from GRACE satellites. We will address two specific scenarios:

    GRACE problem: Filling in gaps in the GRACE ACC time series, similar to the missing data we often observe since 2011.
    GRACE Follow-On problem: Taking data from one satellite and applying it to another satellite.

An important detail to consider is that the travel time between GRACE A and GRACE B is approximately 25 to 35 seconds.
